PROJECT EQUAL - EEG Quality User-Assessment Lab

Project Equal is an open-source, community-based project started at Divergence Neuro (www.divergenceneuro.com) that focuses on the transparent, open, and participatory evaluation of EEG recordings from various EEG devices to assess the quality of EEG recordings. 

We aim to engage the neurotech community at large in order to increase the transparency, participation, and utility of user-driven data collection and data quality evaluation efforts for various EEG devices.
